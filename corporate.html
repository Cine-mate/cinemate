          <ul>
            <li class="text-white">Our <strong>testing goals</strong> were the following:&nbsp;</li>
			  <ul>
            <li class="text-white">Assessing the overall usability and functionality of the CineMate website.</li>
            <li class="text-white">Evaluating the effectiveness of user registration and profile features</li>

            <li class="text-white">Identifying potential performance issues or errors&nbsp;</li>
              </ul>
<li class="text-white"> Our<strong> testing methods:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>We invited 8 people, all aged around 20 years old, who enjoy the cinema experience. All of the participants are active on social media platforms for about 3 to 4 hours per day, which fits our target audience.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </li>
    <li>Most tests were conducted at Breda University of Applied Sciences on a one-on-one basis. We set up the website on their computer (would generate the most relevant user-experience as they are familiar with their laptop) and let the participant discover and use the website like they normally would. </li>
    <li>Our participants were giving a certain set of tasks, such as subscribing to the news letter, finding the values, and finding the Lean Canvas on the website. We let them think out loud, which means that they were telling us live what they were doing and what they thought of it. These findings were recorded in a Word document for us to analyze later on in the process.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
  </ul>

          <p class="text-white">Below, you can find a short summary of our Lean Canvas. For a more detailed description, including detailed explanations, we would like to direct you to <strong><em>Appendix 1.1</em>. </strong>For a visual overview of the lean canvases and the developments throughout the phases, we would like to refer to <strong><em>Appendix 1.2</em></strong>.</p>

          <p class="fw-bold text-white">Problem</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="text-white">Top 4 problems: The times of the movie screenings can be inconvenient, the food and beverage options are expensive, there is a lack of discounts and promotions for students, and people do not always have someone to go to the cinema with.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            <li class="text-white">At this moment, most of these problems are not solved yet. Some theaters offer special discounts for students on their food and beverage options, but these are mostly smaller theaters that do not offer the premium formats that people want to see.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold text-white">Solution</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="text-white">Possible solutions: Voting on times, range of pricing tiers, creating a meeting spot where people can make new connections.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold text-white">Customer segments</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="text-white">Our target customers are Gen Z students aged between 18 to 24 (all genders) who go to the cinema for entertainment purposes and to fulfill social needs and who have a high interest and passion for movies.</li>
            <li class="text-white">Our ideal customer (Anna) is a student who loves social connections. She works part-time and visits the theater to hang out with people and socialize. She doesn't have the biggest friend group, so often it is difficult to find friends who want to go to the exact same movie together.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold text-white">Unique value proposition</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="text-white">CineMate is a unique and compelling website on which people can make connections with other movie-buffs to enjoy the wonders of movies together.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold text-white">Unfair advantage</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="text-white">First mover advantage: There is no company that offers the solution that we do.</li>
            <li class="text-white">Innovative features and technology: With our platform, we combine a couple of the most famous technologies coupled with new ones, such as the Tinder swiping principle, and a state-of-the-art forum where people can discuss their favorite movie.</li>
            <li class="text-white">Exclusive student focus: Our platform is the only one in the world that has an exclusive student focus regarding socializing over movies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold text-white">Channels</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="text-white">Our main path to consumers is our website: CineMate</li>

          <ul>
            <li class="text-white">CineMate is a platform that brings movie enthusiasts who are looking for someone to go to the theater with together. By using the platform, people who normally would not go to cinema because they do not know someone to go with can enjoy the wonders of movies together.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
            <li class="text-white">CineMate is fairly straightforward and easy to understand, just like our brand image! We chose for a minimalistic, yet recognizable look for our project to appeal to our target audience: Gen Zers between 18 and 24. The colors chosen for the brand represent the cozy feeling of going to the theater together mixed with the luxury and nostalgic colors of it.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
