              Colour scheme:
              <ul class="list-unstyled" style="color: #ffffff;">
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #000060;"></span>
                <strong> #012F3D</strong>: This deep blue color matched cinema aesthetic, unlike red and gold, it did not represent the cinema aesthetic, but it added a hint of contrast whilst keeping that cinema elegance and fun. We used this color when we needed contrast or wanted to make something stand out. Simply we could have used black, but we felt like that would take away the welcoming look and feel of the website. This deep blue keeps the site looking welcoming and fun, whilst keeping things minimalistic and simple. </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #d1b266;"></span>
                 <strong> #DLB266</strong>: This color was the closest color of gold. Gold closely resembles success, warmth, and luxury. With our website, we want to give a warm welcoming feeling, this color does that well while keeping it minimalistic. Gold is also picked to represent success and luxury. Think about when a movie wins an award, the award is gold. The walk of fame star? Gold. Gold represents the success of this website and how it allows you to find someone to watch a successful movie with.</li>
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #800000"></span>
                 <strong> #5F1A1F</strong>: This dark burgundy red is the main color of cinema. This red is familiar as most cinemas have this color, at least stereotypically. It is not too bright where it takes away the minimalism, and it is not too dark where you don't feel unwelcome. It is just right and will be the main color of the website and all that it has to offer.</li>
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #ffffff;"></span>
                 <strong> #FFFFFF</strong>: The basic white color allows text to stand out when combined with the dark blue and dark red colors. It allows for easy reading and attention grabbing.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li class="text-white"><strong><em>Font:</em></strong></li>
            <p class="text-white"><strong>Prata:</strong> We used this font for its elegant and timeless appeal. The font allows the text to appear balanced, and easy to read, while also giving that warm and welcoming feeling. This font can evoke a sense of trustworthiness, welcomeness, and minimalism. Unlike ariel font or times new roman, which is widely used and feels very basic, we wanted our font to have a hint of elegance and warmth without reminding you of your work and school fonts. This font is simple, yet it stands out.</p>
            <li class="text-white"><em><strong>User Interface Patterns:</strong></em></li>
            <p class="text-white">We use navigation tabs at the top of our website for fast and efficient movement between the pages. In the about us page, we use card patterns to present our team and their contact information.</p>
            <li class="text-white"><em><strong>Structure of the navigation and content:</strong></em> </li>
            <p class="text-white">The landing page is a welcome page, introducing our brand and giving you the choice to start now. Right under that, without having to scroll down, the user will see what the website has to offer. And right below there will be famous quotes form movies, new quotes daily. The about us page will have the brand vision, mission, and core values. It then introduces the team and their contact information. </p>
            <li class="text-white">
                <em> <strong> How the website design fits the values and personality of the brand</strong></em></li>
                <p class="text-white">The colors that are used (Burgundy Red : #5F1A1F and  Vegas Gold: #DLB266) represent the colors of cinema. These colors are used to make the link of our brand to the cinema experience easy to recognize and keep the general look of the website. Burgundy Red is used as the general background of the media that our brand produces. Vegas Gold is used to outline images and other parts that need attention. 
                The 2 fonts used are  Genty and Prata. Genty is used for the text that needs to stand out, such as text in the logo and for the name of the brand. This font is fancy and playful font that catches the attention of the reader. For normal text, the Prata font is used. Prata is an elegant and readable font. The font has sharp features and organic teardrops. </p>

          <ul>
            <li class="text-white">Our <strong>testing goals</strong> were the following:&nbsp;</li>
			  <ul>
            <li class="text-white">Assessing the overall usability and functionality of the CineMate website.</li>
            <li class="text-white">Evaluating the effectiveness of user registration and profile features</li>

            <li class="text-white">Identifying potential performance issues or errors&nbsp;</li>
              </ul>
<li class="text-white"> Our<strong> testing methods:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>We invited 8 people, all aged around 20 years old, who enjoy the cinema experience. All of the participants are active on social media platforms for about 3 to 4 hours per day, which fits our target audience.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </li>
    <li>Most tests were conducted at Breda University of Applied Sciences on a one-on-one basis. We set up the website on their computer (would generate the most relevant user-experience as they are familiar with their laptop) and let the participant discover and use the website like they normally would. </li>
    <li>Our participants were giving a certain set of tasks, such as subscribing to the news letter, finding the values, and finding the Lean Canvas on the website. We let them think out loud, which means that they were telling us live what they were doing and what they thought of it. These findings were recorded in a Word document for us to analyze later on in the process.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
  </ul>
</li>
            <li class="text-white">Our <strong>testing results</strong>:

          <h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5 text-white">Marketing</h2>
          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2 text-white">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
          <li class="text-white"><strong>Target Audience</strong></li>
          <p class="text-white">The target audience for ‘’CineMate’’ is male and female Gen Z students between 18 and 24 years old who like to go to watch movies in cinemas to fulfill social needs and for entertainment purposes. Some key characteristics about our target audience are that they are currently growing up. As Gen Z ranges from people born between the mid-1990s and early 2010s, they are either teenagers or adults. For these people, socializing and meeting other people is extremely important as it helps them form their view on the world. Another important characteristic is that they are prone to anxiety. This is why they often prefer to do things together with other people (friends, family, etc.) It is proven that social connections and good mental health lead to lower rates of anxiety and depression and lead to a higher self-esteem and greater empathy. Furthermore, social media is central to the lives of the people in Gen Z. Platforms such as Instagram, Snapchat, X, and TikTok shape the culture they consume and bring new perspectives. People in Gen Z can be found on multiple platforms, but YouTube is the most-used platform with over 80% spending their time on there. The second most popular platform is Instagram with over 75% spending their time on that platform. The third and fourth place go to TikTok (69%) and Snapchat (63%). The biggest part of Gen Zers spends over four hours a day on social media, which is a drop from 2022. This suggests that they are becoming more aware of the influence of these platforms over their lives and that they are trying to spend more time together in real life instead of on screens. For all the Gen Zers on social media platforms, 68% uses it for entertainment, which has a huge potential. Coupled with the fact that Gen Zers actively seek out new brands rather than existing brands on social media means that there is a huge untapped potential there.</p>
			<li class="text-white"><strong><em>Communication Objective</em></strong></li>
			<p class="text-white">As Gen Z likes to engage with social media content, one of our goals is to create interaction with our content by encouraging likes, comments, and shares. One of the ways in which we can make that happen is through polls asking our viewers which movie they would rather watch or what their favorite guilty pleasure is. Another example would be to post a picture asking our followers to tag their favorite movie buddy. This would bring a whole new audience to our page through the power of sharing and friendship. 
Throughout the timeline of this project, we would like to reach 75 to 100 followers on our Instagram page and 50 followers on our TikTok page. The average number of followers for an Instagram user is around 150, so if we manage to reach our follower goal, it could mean we have a potential reach of 15,000 people. To reach these goals, we will use multiple strategies like collaborations and the use of relevant hashtags to attract new followers.
Another objective would be to increase brand awareness. We will do this through consistent posting, our brand aesthetic, and storytelling. For our Instagram posts, our goal is to have an average reach of 150 people per post. For TikTok, this would be an average reach of 750 people per post.
With our posts, we want to bring forward a few emotions with our target audience. Firstly, we want to give them a sense of inclusion and belonging. We want our audience to feel a sense of belonging knowing there is an entire community of people who are waiting to connect with them to go to the cinema together. Secondly, we would like to bring a sense of excitement and anticipation. The goal is for our audience to look forward to the potential of discovering new movies and making new and meaningful connections with others who share their passion. Thirdly, we want our audience to feel relief. For the people who often find themselves watching movies alone due to the lack of people who want to go with them, our posts might bring a sense of relief as they know they are not alone. Lastly, we want our posts to bring a certain curiosity. After seeing our posts, we want our audience to have the feeling they want to learn more about the platform and how they can use it.
After seeing our posts on both Instagram and TikTok, we want our audience to create an account on CineMate to start connecting with other movie enthusiasts and to make new and meaningful connections. As mentioned earlier, we also want our audience to engage with our content in order to reach a wider audience. We will generate this through asking questions and inviting opinions. Lastly, we want our audience to invite their friends and spread the word about CineMate. We can work with referral codes so they can get a discount on our premium membership.</p>
			

			
			<ul>
<li class="text-white"><strong><em>Media Tactics</em></strong></li>
<p>To reach our communication objectives, we will use two platforms: Instagram and TikTok. At this moment, Instagram is the second most popular social media platform for Gen Zers, so there is a huge potential for us there. Our target audience expect us on Instagram, so having a verified account on there suggests that our business is real and transparent. Through our Instagram page, we can point our audience back to the CineMate website where they can create an account. As the attention span of Gen Zers is fairly low, TikTok is also a perfect platform to base ourselves. In the last couple of years, TikTok has become a place where there is a lot of viral content and where trends start. As we are a starting business, and thus a small creator, we can create content that goes viral and that reaches thousands of viewers. Besides that, TikTok is the perfect place for short-form video content that can be easily enjoyed in a matter of seconds. The content and trends on TikTok are often funny and relatable, making it appealing to a wide range of users. This way, it is easy to reach our audience and expend it.</p>

<h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
          <p>Identify and justify your learning point (based on the Communication and Media Plan). What did you learn during the duration of the project concerning the campaign? What worked and what didn’t? What went as expected and what didn’t? What would you do differently? Reflect on the past work and describe what you learned.</p>
          <h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4 text-white">Future Planning</h4>
          <p class="text-white"><em></em>Cinemate has made a website and has started advertising via social media. Several members of our target audience have been interviewed for research and for opinions on our idea. In the future, Cinemate will need to find cinemas and surrounding companies like restaurants and entertainment companies to discuss possible sponsorships. With these sponsorships, cinema locations can be added to our app and deals for food and other activities can be added to the 'Offers and Deals' tab. We can offer those companies more customers in exchange of discount codes that we can give away on our platform. On social media, we will be giving away special codes for people to download the early access version of Cinemate. The chatrooms will be opened and the match program will be tested for the first time. People participating in this early access will get the “Beta Tester” title, that can be added to their profile. This will display their dedication to Cinemate and will show others that they are eager to make new friends.</p>
          <p class="text-white">As for future recommendations, we advise the company to make as many partnerships as possible. Most known theater brands usually already have made deals with local  companies. A good start could be to make connections with those  theaters first to create a good network. The next step should be offline advertising in and near the theaters and entertainment companies, with further expansions to city centers in mind. Another point of interest is online advertising. Cinemate already has 2 social media platforms and a website to host information. When the budget allows it, paid advertising is something worth investing in. Paid advertising means that possible leads get the CineMate app advertised on their for-you pages, spreading the word and making the app known.</p>
          <p class="text-white">We learnt that consistency is the key when it comes to social media campaigns. It was very hard to always stay on track of our goals and to publish the content when it was needed, so we would have a better structure if we were to do this again. Another important lesson that we have learnt is that authenticity is also really important and that we might need a more exclusive visual styling. As Gen Zers are very specific with what they like, we must make sure that our visual style is striking enough to keep their attention. We can do this through the use of more visual content like videos for example.&nbsp; The last lesson is that we should learn from failures and carefully look at which content performed well and which content didn't. In that way, we know what content we have to reproduce in order to create engagement.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p class="fw-bold text-white">Problem</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="text-white">Top 4 problems: The times of the movie screenings can be inconvenient, the food and beverage options are expensive, there is a lack of discounts and promotions for students, and people do not always have someone to go to the cinema with.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            <li class="text-white">At this moment, most of these problems are not solved yet. Some theaters offer special discounts for students on their food and beverage options, but these are mostly smaller theaters that do not offer the premium formats that people want to see.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold text-white">Solution</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="text-white">Possible solutions: Voting on times, range of pricing tiers, creating a meeting spot where people can make new connections.</li>

            <li class="text-white">Our ideal customer (Anna) is a student who loves social connections. She works part-time and visits the theater to hang out with people and socialize. She doesn't have the biggest friend group, so often it is difficult to find friends who want to go to the exact same movie together.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
