          <h4 id="production-1" class="mt-2 text-white">Design Elements</h4>
          <ul class="text-white">
            <li class="text-white">
              Colour scheme:
              <ul class="list-unstyled" style="color: #ffffff;">
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #000060;"></span>
                <strong> #012F3D</strong>: This deep blue color matched cinema aesthetic, unlike red and gold, it did not represent the cinema aesthetic, but it added a hint of contrast whilst keeping that cinema elegance and fun. We used this color when we needed contrast or wanted to make something stand out. Simply we could have used black, but we felt like that would take away the welcoming look and feel of the website. This deep blue keeps the site looking welcoming and fun, whilst keeping things minimalistic and simple. </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #d1b266;"></span>
                 <strong> #DLB266</strong>: This color was the closest color of gold. Gold closely resembles success, warmth, and luxury. With our website, we want to give a warm welcoming feeling, this color does that well while keeping it minimalistic. Gold is also picked to represent success and luxury. Think about when a movie wins an award, the award is gold. The walk of fame star? Gold. Gold represents the success of this website and how it allows you to find someone to watch a successful movie with.</li>
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #800000"></span>
                 <strong> #5F1A1F</strong>: This dark burgundy red is the main color of cinema. This red is familiar as most cinemas have this color, at least stereotypically. It is not too bright where it takes away the minimalism, and it is not too dark where you don't feel unwelcome. It is just right and will be the main color of the website and all that it has to offer.</li>
                <li> <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #ffffff;"> </span> <strong> #FFFFFF</strong>: The basic white color allows text to stand out when combined with the dark blue and dark red colors. It allows for easy reading and attention grabbing.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li style="padding-bottom: 20px;">
        Font: We used Prata for its elegant and timeless appeal. The font allows the text to appear balanced, and easy to read, while also giving that warm and welcoming feeling. This font can evoke a sense of trustworthiness, welcomeness, and minimalism. Unlike ariel font or times new roman, which is widely used and feels very basic, we wanted our font to have a hint of elegance and warmth without reminding you of your work and school fonts. This font is simple, yet it stands out.
    </li>
            
<li>User Interface Patterns: We use navigation tabs at the top of our website for fast and efficient movement between the pages. In the about us page, we use card patterns to present our team and their contact information.</li>
            <li>Structure of the navigation and content: The landing page is a welcome page, introducing our brand and giving you the choice to start now. Right under that, without having to scroll down, the user will see what the website has to offer. And right below there will be famous quotes form movies, new quotes daily. The about us page will have the brand vision, mission, and core values. It then introduces the team and their contact information. </li>

            <li>How the website design fits the values and personality of the brand: The colors that are used (Burgundy Red : #5F1A1F and  Vegas Gold: #DLB266) represent the colors of cinema. These colors are used to make the link of our brand to the cinema experience easy to recognize and keep the general look of the website. Burgundy Red is used as the general background of the media that our brand produces. Vegas Gold is used to outline images and other parts that need attention. The 2 fonts used are  Genty and Prata. Genty is used for the text that needs to stand out, such as text in the logo and for the name of the brand. This font is fancy and playful font that catches the attention of the reader. For normal text, the Prata font is used. Prata is an elegant and readable font. The font has sharp features and organic teardrops.</li>
 
                <li>How the website design fits the marketing and communication strategy: For the marketing and communication strategy, the main goal was to increase brand awareness and to generate interaction with the CineMate brand itself. The website beautifully contributes to these goals by offering visitors multiple ways to engage and interact with the brand. For example, links to the social media pages of the brand can be found in multiple places on the website, such as the header and footer for easy access. Visitors can also engage with the brand by signing up for the newsletter on the landing page. Through this widget, they can easily stay up-to-date with the latest news regarding CineMate and its offerings. Furthermore, as Gen Zers have a small attention span, we made the website as dynamic as possible with various different elements and designs spread throughout the site without interrupting our iconic and easily recognizable style. This makes sure that the visitors stay interested in the website and are eager to see more and scroll through the pages.</li>
		    
<li>How the website showcases the unique value proposition of the product: The unique value proposition of the product is a website where connections are made to enhance the cinema experience where film enthousiasts can enjoy the theater experience together. The CineMate website showcases this value proposition in multiple ways. For example, it is made clear that this website is to make new connections and friends. This is done on the home page with a popular quote from Monsters, Inc. for example. It is also visible in the use of language throughout the website. Throughout the information, you can find many easter-eggs to famous couples of friends in movies that everyone can recognize.</li>

    <li>We invited 8 people, all aged around 20 years old, who enjoy the cinema experience. All of the participants are active on social media platforms for about 3 to 4 hours per day, which fits our target audience.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </li>
    <li>Most tests were conducted at Breda University of Applied Sciences on a one-on-one basis. We set up the website on their computer (would generate the most relevant user-experience as they are familiar with their laptop) and let the participant discover and use the website like they normally would. </li>
    <li>Our participants were giving a certain set of tasks, such as subscribing to the news letter, finding the values, and finding the Lean Canvas on the website. We let them think out loud, which means that they were telling us live what they were doing and what they thought of it. These findings were recorded in a Word document for us to analyze later on in the process.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </li>

          <h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5 text-white">Marketing</h2>
          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2 text-white">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
          <p class="text-white">To reach our communication objectives, we will use two platforms: Instagram and 
            TikTok. At this moment, Instagram is the second most popular social media platform for 
            Gen Zers, so there is a huge potential for us there. Our target audience are Gen Zers between 18 and 24 years old and they expect us on 
            Instagram, so having a verified account on there suggests that our business is real and 
            transparent. Through our Instagram page, we can point our audience back to the 
            CineMate website where they can create an account. As the attention span of Gen Zers 
            is fairly low, TikTok is also a perfect platform to base ourselves. In the last couple of 
            years, TikTok has become a place where there is a lot of viral content and where trends 
            start. As we are a starting business, and thus a small creator, we can create content that 
            goes viral and that reaches thousands of viewers. Besides that, TikTok is the perfect 
            place for short-form video content that can be easily enjoyed in a matter of seconds. 
            The content and trends on TikTok are often funny and relatable, making it appealing to a 
            wide range of users. This way, it is easy to reach our audience and expend it. </p>
          <p class="text-white">Specific: The marketing campaign focused on consumer engagement and getting exposed as a brand. We created content on social media platforms that followed modern trends while sticking to our theme  and vision in order to reach our Gen Z target audience. Our vision: In a world where going to the cinemas can feel lonely, we believe it is important that you can make connections, because only then can you truly enjoy the cinema experience.With our media content, we wanted to create relatability (because that is what Gen Z reacts to) and to stay connected to Gen Z through the use of trends. One of our objectives was to create interactions with our content by encouraging likes, comments, and shares. Our other objective was to create brand awareness.</p>
          <p class="text-white">Measurable: Interactions and awareness can be measured by looking at the number of views, likes, comments, and shares a post has. For example, our goal was to raise brand awareness, and looking at the numbers, the lowest views we had was 101, and the most was 1,398. Average was roughly 950 per post and we made 9 posts. That is around 4,750 viewers in total. So in 4 weeks, we started gaining awareness well and with more time it would increase.&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="text-white">Achievable: Raising brand awareness and increasing interactions using our strategy is definitely achievable and its been working since the first week. By creating relatable and trendy content, we got more retention and interactions. One of the ways in which we did that was through polls, asking our viewers which movie they would rather watch or what their favorite guilty pleasure is. Another was a sad hamster trend. Where you portray a sad hamster (aka, you) that likes something others do not or is lonely. So, we made a post where your friends all want to watch Oppenheimer, but you, alone, want to watch Barbie. And that did well in terms of relatability and sticking to a new trend. So, we make the audience relate to feeling alone when it comes to going to the movies, and in the caption, we say “CineMate coming soon” or “ CineMate will help you”. So, the post shows the problem our target group relates to, and the problem we are trying to solve, and that caption tells them that there is an answer to their problems coming soon.&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="text-white">Relevant: Sticking to the trends is a relevant strategy as our target group is Gen Z who are into current trends. It is easier to access the pool of views using this tactic. For example, we used several trends on TikTok like the sad hamster meme and the Barbenheimer momentum.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
          <p class="text-white">Temporary: Within the first 4 weeks we surpassed our internal goal of viewers, but not followers. So in terms of brand awareness and temporary interactions this tactic definitely works. If we stick to the same path, it will continue to progress. </p>
			<p>All of the information above corresponds with our Media and Communication Plan, which can be found in <strong><em>Appendix 1.5</em></strong></p>
<h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
          <p class="text-white">We learned different things based on the different social media platforms that we have used throughout this project:</p>
          <p class="text-white">For Instagram, we have learned that gaining followers is easier than it was on TikTok, but not as easy as expected. Our goal was to reach between 75 and 100 followers on Instagram. As of 03-04, we collected 67 followers. This means that our goal was too ambitious and not reached, but it was a very interesting learning experience. This also tells us that we needed more time to get the amount of followers that we initially wanted. Another possible thing for the future is to use more relevant hashtags in our posts so it generates more views and more potential followers. That also opens up another interesting insight to see which hashtags lead to a better performance and which ones don't, thus offering a better view of what content we need to continue producing. The average of reached accounts was 150 for every post, which is definitely not a bad start for a start-up.&nbsp; The posts that generated the most buzz and engagement were the posts that were actively trying to generate engagement, such as posts where you had to tag your future CineMate and one that asked viewers to describe their perfect CineMate. From this, we learnt that the posts that actively include the viewers in the conversation work the best and that those posts are the best way to go forward with the project. The posts that performed the worst were the posts that just plain introduced the company and its goals to everyone. The posts were not really engaging and interesting to our viewer, so we learnt that that type of content does not work for our target audience.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-white">Reflecting on our Tiktok campaign, we can conclude that we made significant success towards achieving our objectives to gain viewership. We aimed for 750 views per post, but our actual results surpassed these expectations, which posts fluctuating between 800 and 1400 views. However, our follower amount didn’t meet our expectations. We were aiming to reach around 50 followers but only got 12 people. From this, we can conclude that Tiktok consumers are more into short-term interactions rather than long-term interactions. This can also mean that TikTok might not be the ideal platform for a start-up, but rather for a company with an already built fanbase. The average amount of likes is around 25/30. The amount of likes shows us how many people were interested in our idea and could possibly keep track of our page. The posts that generated the most engagement and views were the posts based around viral trends and music, such as the sad hamster meme. For example, the post about the sad hamster illustrating the difference between Barbie and Oppenheimer generated the most views with over 1,400 views. This tells us that videos based around viral trends tend to perform better and that that is the best way to move forward on this platform. The posts that performed the worst were the posts that introduced the company and the ones that were not based around viral sensations. This learnt us that TikTok is not a platform to post plain content and that you must always go with the latest trends to generate the most views and engagement. .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4 text-white">Future Planning</h4>
          <p class="text-white"><em></em>Cinemate has made a website and has started advertising via social media. Several members of our target audience have been interviewed for research and for opinions on our idea. In the future, Cinemate will need to find cinemas and surrounding companies like restaurants and entertainment companies to discuss possible sponsorships. With these sponsorships, cinema locations can be added to our websiteand deals for food and other activities can be added to the 'Offers and Deals' tab. We can offer those companies more customers in exchange of discount codes that we can give away on our platform. On social media, we will be giving away special codes for people to download the early access version of Cinemate. The chatrooms will be opened and the match program will be tested for the first time. People participating in this early access will get the “Beta Tester” title, that can be added to their profile. This will display their dedication to Cinemate and will show others that they are eager to make new friends.</p>
          <p class="text-white">As for future recommendations, we advise the company to make as many partnerships as possible. Most known theater brands usually already have made deals with local  companies. A good start could be to make connections with those  theaters first to create a good network. The next step should be offline advertising in and near the theaters and entertainment companies, with further expansions to city centers in mind. Another point of interest is online advertising. Cinemate already has 2 social media platforms and a website to host information. When the budget allows it, paid advertising is something worth investing in. Paid advertising means that possible leads get the CineMate app advertised on their for-you pages, spreading the word and making the app known.</p>
          <p class="text-white">We learnt that consistency is the key when it comes to social media campaigns. It was very hard to always stay on track of our goals and to publish the content when it was needed, so we would have a better structure if we were to do this again. Another important lesson that we have learnt is that authenticity is also really important and that we might need a more exclusive visual styling. As Gen Zers are very specific with what they like, we must make sure that our visual style is striking enough to keep their attention. We can do this through the use of more visual content like videos for example.&nbsp; The last lesson is that we should learn from failures and carefully look at which content performed well and which content didn't. In that way, we know what content we have to reproduce in order to create engagement.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

		  <p class="text-white">Above, you can find all of the posts that we made for our Instagram account. As our target audience, Gen Zers, prefer simple, but also unique content, we decided to go with one overall style and apply it to all the posts on the platform. In the posts, we made a good use of our color palette with the Burgundy Red and Vegas Gold to have one distinct style that is easily recognizable. Furthermore, we stayed consistent with the fonts and placement of the logo. To offer a variety of content, we decided to post different kinds of posts to keep our audience interested, such as a simple question post that generates engagement, a carousel that introduces the team, an explanation of what our platform exactly is and a recognizable quote followed by a question to generate some engagement again.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

          <p class="fw-bold text-white">Problem</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="text-white">Top 4 problems: The times of the movie screenings can be inconvenient, the food and beverage options are expensive, there is a lack of discounts and promotions for students, and people do not always have someone to go to the cinema with.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            <li class="text-white">At this moment, most of these problems are not solved yet. Some theaters offer special discounts for students on their food and beverage options, but these are mostly smaller theaters that do not offer the premium formats that people want to see.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold text-white">Solution</p>
          <ul>

            <li class="text-white">Our ideal customer (Anna) is a student who loves social connections. She works part-time and visits the theater to hang out with people and socialize. She doesn't have the biggest friend group, so often it is difficult to find friends who want to go to the exact same movie together.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</li>

          <h4 id="management-7" class="mt-2">Validation of Assumptions</h4>
          <p>Based on the problem- and solution interviews, we were able to further develop the CineMate brand. First of all, we first wanted to focus on some other issues, such as high prices for food &amp; beverage options. Based on the problem interviews, we were able to specify a bit more to the problem that people often cannot find someone to go to the cinema with. We did get confirmation from our target audience that they liked our design and colors, so that validated our assumptions about certain design choices.</p>
		  <p>Beforehand, we made a couple of assumptions on our target audience, such as the fact that they are growing up and looking for more social connections. Another assumption we made was regarding the social media platforms they use. We made the assumption that our target audience mostly use Instagram and TikTok as their main platforms where they come across content. We made these assumptions as we are in our target audience ourselves, so we first looked at what some of our own characteristics were to have a solid foundation for the problem interviews. After the interviews, we concluded that most of our assumptions were correct, but we also had to change a couple of things as they were just personal to us and not well-known in general to the people we interviewed. </p>
